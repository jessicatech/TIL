Today I Learned... 

The goal of Today I Learned is to regularly* publish a quick overview about something I have learnt. 

These are unlikely to be ground breaking, but it will serve as a useful tool for me to fight future imposter syndrome with! 

I tweet regularly [@JessBuildsTech](https://twitter.com/JessBuildsTech), in case that's your thing come and say hello!
